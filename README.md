# MY FAVORITE MOVIE!!!

**Back to the future**

*Sci-fi Movie, made in 1985*

[Back to the future: The Movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_to_the_Future)

> The movie is nostalgic and a personal favorite! It uses a Time Machine called the "DeLorean Automobile" which travels through time when it reaches "88 mph"!
> It is a extremely cool and well made movie during its time, with visual effect and edits that only a few can replicate!
> I wished it becomes a reality in the near future, I want to jump through time and space with this awesome "Time Machine", although it looks more like a car than a Time Machine... heh.
